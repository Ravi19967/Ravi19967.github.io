Meet Ravi, the data wrangler extraordinaire in the electrifying world of battery cell production! Armed with spreadsheets and a knack for decoding data, Ravi's on a mission to turn numbers into insights faster than a Tesla goes from 0 to 60. When he's not knee-deep in datasets, you can catch him recharging on a hike or reading a book. Disclamer, he has a rare condition that makes everything look like a database, you might catch him organizing his cereal boxes by expiration date or categorizing his sock drawer by color and fabric.
